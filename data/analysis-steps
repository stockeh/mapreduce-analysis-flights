Count the number of delays for the origin airport due to both incoming and outgoing flights.

Compute the total number of flights in and out of that airport, and add it to the total for that coast.

Calculate the percentage of delayed flights for each coast by dividing the total number of coast delays by the total number of flights on that coast.
